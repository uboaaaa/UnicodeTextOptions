UnicodeTextOptions is a BetterDiscord plugin that can spice up your dry-ass conversations on Discord with a variety of unicode text styles.

Currently supported styles include /cursive, /gothic, /small (smallcaps), /sub (subscript), /sup (superscript), /zalgo.

To use, simply type /[command] "your text here" anywhere in your message. 

*Certain letters do not have sub / superscript representations due to Unicode shenanigans, so some outputs may look iffy.
